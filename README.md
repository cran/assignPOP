Population Assignment using Genetic, Non-Genetic or Integrated Data in a Machine-learning Framework

## Description
This R package helps perform population assignment and infer population structure using a machine-learning framework. It employs supervised machine-learning methods to evaluate the discriminatory power of your data collected from source populations, and is able to analyze **large genetic, non-genetic, or integrated (genetic plus non-genetic) data** sets. This framework is designed for solving the upward bias issue discussed in previous studies. Main features are listed as follows.

- Use principle component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction (or data transformation)
- Use Monte-Carlo cross-validation to estimate mean and variance of assignment accuracy
- Use *K*-fold cross-validation to estimate membership probability
- Allow to resample various sizes of training datasets (proportions or fixed numbers of individuals and proportions of loci)
- Allow to choose from various proportions of training loci either randomly or based on locus *Fst* values
- Provide several machine-learning classification algorithms, including LDA, SVM, naive Bayes, decision tree, and random forest, to build tunable predictive models.
- Output results in publication-quality plots that can be modified using ggplot2 functions

## Install assignPOP
You can install the released version from CRAN or the up-to-date version from this Github respository.

- To install from CRAN
  * Simply enter `install.packages("assignPOP")` in your R console

- To install from Github
  * step 1. Install devtools package by entering `install.packages("devtools")`
  * step 2. Import the library, `library(devtools)`
  * step 3. Then enter `install_github("alexkychen/assignPOP")` 

Note: When you install the package from Github, you may need to install additional packages before the assignPOP can be successfully installed. Follow the hints that R provided and then re-run `install_github("alexkychen/assignPOP")`.
